Template scripts for working with the Scopus APIs

# Overview
This package includes a set of scripts that can be used to query the Scopus API (application program interface). Although these particular scripts are written in PHP (http://www.php.net/) with API calls executed via cURL, any other scripting language that enables interaction with a RESTful API would produce similar results.
